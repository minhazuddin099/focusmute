# FocusMute

Hotkey mute control for Focusrite Scarlett 4th Gen interfaces.

FocusMute monitors your system microphone's mute state and reflects it on your Focusrite Scarlett interface LEDs in real time. When you mute, the input number indicator LEDs ("1", "2") turn your chosen color (default: red). When you unmute, they are restored to their firmware colors (green for the selected input, white for unselected). Metering halos and all other LEDs are never touched. It runs as a system tray app on Windows and Linux with hotkey support, or as a CLI on both platforms.

## Features

- Configurable mute indicator color (any hex color or named color)
- Global hotkey toggle (default: Ctrl+Shift+M)
- Sound feedback on mute/unmute (built-in or custom WAV)
- Auto-reconnect on device disconnect (exponential backoff) and graceful startup without device
- Desktop notifications on mute/unmute (optional)
- Hook commands on mute state change (run arbitrary shell commands)
- Per-input targeting (all input number LEDs, or specific ones like "1" or "1,2")
- Per-input mute colors (different color per input number LED)
- Schema-driven multi-model support (auto-discovers unknown Scarlett 4th Gen devices)
- Device serial targeting (multi-device setups)
- Settings GUI (tray app) and TOML config file

## Supported Devices

| Device | Support |
|--------|---------|
| Scarlett 2i2 4th Gen | Full (hardcoded LED profile) |
| Scarlett Solo / 4i4 4th Gen | Auto-discovery via firmware schema extraction |
| Scarlett 16i16 / 18i16 / 18i20 4th Gen | Untested — likely works on Windows; requires unimplemented FCP Socket protocol on Linux |

The small 4th Gen models (Solo, 2i2, 4i4) use the TRANSACT/hwdep protocol which FocusMute fully implements. The big models (16i16, 18i16, 18i20) use a different communication path on Linux (FCP Socket via a daemon process). On Windows they likely work through the same SwRoot driver, but this is unverified without hardware.

The `probe` command can detect any Scarlett 4th Gen device and extract its LED layout from firmware. Use `map` to interactively verify the predicted layout.

## Installation

### Windows

Download the MSI installer or standalone `.exe` from [Releases](../../releases).

- `focusmute.exe` -- system tray app (tray icon, hotkey, settings dialog)
- `focusmute-cli.exe` -- CLI-only binary

### Linux

**Prerequisites:** `libpulse0` (PulseAudio), `libgtk-3-0` (GTK 3), `libappindicator3-1` (system tray), `libegl1` (egui rendering). PipeWire works transparently via the `pipewire-pulse` compatibility layer — ensure `pipewire-pulse` or `libpulse0` is installed.

**Debian / Ubuntu / Mint:**

```bash
sudo dpkg -i focusmute_*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f   # resolve any missing deps
```

This installs both binaries (`focusmute` tray app + `focusmute-cli`), udev rules, and desktop entries.

**Arch / Fedora / other (from tar.gz):**

```bash
sudo install -m 755 focusmute focusmute-cli /usr/local/bin/
sudo install -m 644 99-focusrite.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=usb
```

See [dist/linux/README-linux.md](dist/linux/README-linux.md) for full details and desktop entry setup.

## Usage

### Tray App (Windows + Linux)

Launch `focusmute` (or `focusmute.exe` on Windows). It sits in the system tray, monitors your mic, and updates LEDs automatically. Right-click for the menu (Status, Toggle Mute, Settings, Reconnect Device, Quit). The global hotkey (default: Ctrl+Shift+M) toggles mute. If no Scarlett device is connected at startup, the app starts in "Disconnected" mode and automatically connects when the device is plugged in. On exit, inputs are automatically unmuted and LEDs restored to their normal state. The tray app logs to `focusmute.log` in the config directory (info level by default; override with `RUST_LOG` env var). On startup, any config parse errors or validation warnings are shown as a desktop notification.

**Linux notes:** The tray app uses GTK 3. Global hotkeys work on X11; on Wayland they may not function (use the tray menu instead).

### Crate Responsibilities

**focusmute-lib** is the core library. It owns all device communication, LED control, audio monitoring, configuration, and schema parsing. It has no UI dependencies and compiles on both Windows and Linux with platform-specific backends behind `#[cfg]` gates.

**focusmute** is the application layer. It provides two binaries:
- `focusmute` -- system tray app for Windows and Linux (tray icon, hotkey, settings dialog, sound playback)
- `focusmute-cli` -- cross-platform CLI with subcommands for monitoring, diagnostics, and device control

### Module Map

| Module | Responsibility | Key Types |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| `audio` | Mic mute monitoring | `MuteMonitor` trait, `WasapiMonitor`, `PulseAudioMonitor` |
| `config` | TOML settings + validation | `Config`, `IndicatorConfig`, `KeyboardConfig`, `SoundConfig`, `SystemConfig`, `HooksConfig`, `MuteInputs` |
| `context` | Device resolution pipeline | `DeviceContext` |
| `device` | USB communication | `ScarlettDevice` trait, `DeviceInfo`, `FirmwareVersion` |
| `error` | Unified errors | `FocusmuteError`, `DeviceError`, `AudioError` |
| `hooks` | Shell command hooks | `run_action_hook` |
| `layout` | LED layout prediction | `PredictedLayout`, `PredictedLed`, `Confidence` |
| `led/color` | Color parsing | `parse_color`, `format_color` |
| `led/ops` | LED device operations | `apply_mute_indicator`, `clear_mute_indicator`, `restore_on_exit` |
| `led/strategy` | Mute visualization | `MuteStrategy`, `resolve_mute_strategy` |
| `models` | Hardcoded device profiles | `ModelProfile`, `HaloRange`, `detect_model` |
| `monitor` | Mute state machine | `MuteIndicator`, `MuteDebouncer`, `MonitorAction` |
| `offsets` | Descriptor offset calculations | `DeviceOffsets` |
| `protocol` | USB protocol constants | IOCTL codes, command codes, descriptor offsets, notify IDs |
| `reconnect` | Exponential backoff | `ReconnectState` |
| `schema` | Firmware schema extraction | `SchemaConstants`, `extract_schema`, `parse_schema` |

### Data Flow

The monitor loop follows a simple poll-decide-act pipeline:

```
Audio Backend ---poll---> MuteIndicator ---action---> LED ops ---USB---> Device
  (WASAPI /                (debounce +                (single-LED via
   PulseAudio)              decide)                    DATA_NOTIFY(8))
       ^                                                    |
       |                  ReconnectState                    |
       |                  (backoff on                       |
       +--- wait_for_change / 250ms timeout ---<--- disconnect detection)
```

1. The audio backend reports mute state changes (event-driven with 250ms polling fallback).
2. `MuteIndicator` debounces the signal (2-sample threshold) and emits `ApplyMute`, `ClearMute`, or `NoChange`.
3. LED ops translate the action into USB descriptor writes and DATA_NOTIFY(8) commands targeting number indicator LEDs.
4. On communication failure, `ReconnectState` manages exponential backoff until the device reappears.
5. On exit, inputs are unmuted (so the user isn't left silently muted) and number LEDs are restored to firmware colors by reading `selectedInput` (green for selected, white for unselected).

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Trait-based platform abstraction.** `ScarlettDevice` and `MuteMonitor` are traits with platform-specific implementations. This keeps the core logic testable without hardware and makes adding new backends straightforward.

2. **State machine over callbacks.** `MuteIndicator` encapsulates debouncing and mute/unmute transitions as a pure state machine. It is decoupled from I/O -- the caller drives it by feeding mute samples and applying the resulting actions.

3. **Schema-driven multi-model support.** Known devices (Scarlett 2i2 4th Gen) have hardcoded `ModelProfile`s for zero-latency startup. Unknown Scarlett 4th Gen devices are discovered at runtime by extracting the firmware schema (base64 + zlib compressed JSON) and predicting the LED layout from it.

4. **Minimal LED footprint.** Mute indication uses the single-LED update mechanism (`directLEDColour` + `directLEDIndex` + DATA_NOTIFY(8)), targeting only the number indicator LEDs ("1", "2"). Metering halos, output LEDs, and button LEDs are never touched — the device continues normal operation.

5. **Platform-abstracted tray loop.** The `PlatformAdapter` trait injects platform-specific behavior (GTK vs Win32 event pumping, PulseAudio vs WASAPI monitoring) into a shared generic event loop (`run_core<P>`), eliminating ~80% code duplication between Windows and Linux tray implementations.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable)
- **Linux:** `libpulse-dev`, `pkg-config`, `libasound2-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `libxdo-dev`, `libappindicator3-dev`, `libegl-dev`
- **Windows cross-compile:** `gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64`, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target

### Build

```bash
# Linux (native)
sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev pkg-config libasound2-dev libgtk-3-dev libxdo-dev libappindicator3-dev libegl-dev
cargo build --release

# Windows (cross-compile from Linux/WSL2)
sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

Output binaries:
- Linux: `target/release/focusmute`, `target/release/focusmute-cli`
- Windows: `target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/focusmute.exe`, `focusmute-cli.exe`

### Test

```bash
cargo fmt --check                  # formatting
cargo clippy -- -D warnings        # lints
cargo test                         # unit + integration tests
cargo deny check advisories        # dependency vulnerability audit (requires cargo-deny)
```

[cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) is not bundled with the Rust toolchain — install it separately with `cargo install cargo-deny`.

### Packaging

#### .msi

Requires [WiX Toolset v3](https://wixtoolset.org/) (`light.exe` and `candle.exe` on PATH):

```bash
cargo install cargo-wix
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
cargo wix -p focusmute --no-build --nocapture
```

Output: `target/wix/focusmute-<version>-x86_64.msi`

The MSI installs both binaries to `Program Files\Focusmute`, adds a Start Menu shortcut, and optionally adds the install directory to PATH. The WiX source is at `crates/focusmute/wix/main.wxs`.

#### .deb

```bash
cargo install cargo-deb
cargo build --release
cargo deb -p focusmute --no-build
```

Output: `target/debian/focusmute_<version>-1_amd64.deb`

The .deb installs both binaries to `/usr/bin/`, udev rules to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`, desktop entries to `/usr/share/applications/`, and runs `postinst`/`postrm` scripts to reload udev rules. Dependencies (`libpulse0`, `libgtk-3-0`, `libappindicator3-1`, `libegl1`) are declared automatically. The deb metadata is in `crates/focusmute/Cargo.toml` under `[package.metadata.deb]`.
